@article{Alemdar2019,
abstract = {Gallium Nitride Enhancement-Mode High Electron Mobility Transistors (GaN HEMTs) are superior to other power transistors in terms of efficiency, package size and switching speed which leads to increased power density in power converter applications. However, GaN HEMTs have much shorter short-circuit withstand time compared to the conventional devices, which is limited to several hundred nanoseconds. Therefore, reliable and fast protection solutions are required to protect GaN HEMTs from fatal over-current failures. In this paper, a novel short-circuit (SC) protection scheme based on fault current sensing by using Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout parasitics is proposed. The proposed scheme uses the voltage drop on the parasitic inductance of the PCB trace to detect very intense high slew rate SC faults. In addition, the voltage drop on the parasitic resistance of the PCB trace is utilized to detect relatively slow over-current (OC) faults. Once a fault is detected, a soft turn-off mechanism is initiated by the proposed circuit to turnoff devices gradually to eliminate over-voltage breakdown risk. The proposed circuit is verified by both SPICE simulations and hardware implementation. The experimental results show that both SC and OC faults can be detected and GaN HEMTs can be protected. The total operation duration for the circuit is 370 ns during a SC fault. The SC fault can be detected within 30 ns and the soft turn-off mechanism is initiated within 80 ns to terminate the SC current flowing through the GaN HEMTs within 290 ns.},

@article{Umetani2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE. Recent progress of widebandgap semiconductor switching devices enabled extremely high-frequency operation of power converters owing to their ultrafast switching capability. Fast switching may cause large switching noise at the common source inductance, which may increase the switching loss and lead to false triggering. Therefore, measurement of the common source inductance is often intensely required in practical design of fast switching power converters. However, measurement of the common source inductance is difficult, because 1) the wiring path hidden beneath the molded package significantly contributes to this inductance, 2) the mutual inductance between the gating circuit and the power circuit also contributes to this inductance, and 3) this inductance cannot be defined as the stray inductance of a loop wiring path. These difficulties are addressed in this paper by proposing a novel measurement method of the common source inductance. The proposed method is applicable to already-mounted power circuits. In addition, the proposed method offers a straightforward measurement procedure with common instruments, such as a signal generator, an oscilloscope, and voltage and current probes. Along with the measurement principle, this paper also presents an experiment to evaluate the proposed method.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an improved analytical switching process model to calculate the switching loss of low-voltage enhancement-mode Gallium Nitride high-electron mobility transistors (eGaN HEMTs). The presented eGaN HEMTs models are more or less derived from silicon MOSFETs models, whereas eGaN HEMTs are different from three aspects: higher switching speed, much more reduced parasitic inductance in switching loop, and absence of reverse recovery. Applying the traditional model to eGaN HEMTs results in inaccurate prediction of switching waveforms and losses. The proposed model considers the effect of low-parasitic inductances, nonlinearity of junction capacitances, and nonlinearity of transconductance. The turn-on and turn-off switching processes are described in detail and the resulting equations can be easily solved. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by comparing the predicted switching waveforms and converter's efficiency with the experimental results, respectively. Based on the analytical model, the effects of gate resistance, gate supply voltage, and parasitic inductances on switching losses are investigated. Meanwhile, a novel current measuring method based on magnetic coupling is proposed to measure the switching current waveform with improved accuracy.},

The switching process is illustrated in detail, including the interaction of the low voltage Si MOSFET and the high voltage GaN HEMT in cascode configuration. The switching loss is obtained by solving the equivalent circuits during the switching transition. The analytical results show that the turn-on loss dominates in hard-switching conditions while the turn-off loss is negligible, due to the intrinsic current source driving mechanism. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by numerous experimental results.

abstract = {Gallium–nitride power transistor (GaN HEMT) and integrated circuit technologies have matured dramatically over the last few years, and many hundreds of thousands of devices have been manufactured and fielded in applications ranging from pulsed radars and counter-IED jammers to CATV modules and fourth-generation infrastructure base-stations. GaN HEMT devices, exhibiting high power densities coupled with high breakdown voltages, have opened up the possibilities for highly efficient power amplifiers (PAs) exploiting the principles of waveform engineered designs. This paper summarizes the unique advantages of GaN HEMTs compared to other power transistor technologies, with examples of where such features have been exploited. Since RF power densities of GaN HEMTs are many times higher than other technologies, much attention has also been given to thermal management—examples of both commercial “off-the-shelf” packaging as well as custom heat-sinks are described. The very desirable feature of having accurate large-signal models for both discrete transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuit foundry are emphasized with a number of circuit design examples. GaN HEMT technology has been a major enabler for both very broadband high-PAs and very high-efficiency designs. This paper describes examples of broadband amplifiers, as well as several of the main areas of high-efficiency amplifier design—notably Class-D, Class-E, Class-F, and Class-J approaches, Doherty PAs, envelope-tracking techniques, and Chireix outphasing.},

Based on the simulation model, an investigation of the package influence on the cascode GaN HEMT is presented, and several critical parasitic inductances are identified and verified.

The results indicate that the switching loss is a dominant part of the total loss under hard-switching conditions in megahertz high-frequency range and below 8{\~{}}10 A operation current; therefore, soft switching is preferred to achieve high-frequency and high-efficiency operation of the high-voltage GaN HEMT.},

Other static parameters such as transconductance and gate current were also measured. A double pulse test setup was constructed and used to measure switching loss and time at the fastest achievable switching speed, and the subsequent over-voltages due to the fast switching were characterized.

Together with the existing model for the output I-V characteristics, the proposed capacitance model provides the complete set of analytical equations that relate the physical design parameters to the electrical characteristics of the device. The model was verified by the experimental characterization of a HEMT. In comparison to the physics-based models implemented in Finite Element Analysis tools, the obtained capacitance model has substantially lower level of complexity and, therefore, it is more suitable for implementation into iterative design optimization algorithms. In order to verify the proposed model for such usage, the prototype of a high-frequency buck converter was built, using previously modeled GaN HEMT as the main switch. The hybrid analytical-behavioral power loss model of a high-frequency buck converter was implemented into Simplorer simulation tool, using the proposed physics-based model as the device description for the capacitive part.

The electrical loading and device rating are both important factors that determine the loss and thermal behaviors of power semiconductor devices. In the existing loss and thermal models, only the electrical loadings are focused and treated as design variables, while the device rating is normally predefined by experience with limited design flexibility. Consequently, a more complete loss and thermal model is proposed in this paper, which takes into account not only the electrical loading but also the device rating as input variables. The quantified correlation between the power loss, thermal impedance, and silicon area of insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is mathematically established. By this new modeling approach , all factors that have impacts to the loss and thermal profiles of the power devices can accurately be mapped, enabling more design freedom to optimize the efficiency and thermal loading of the power converter. The proposed model can be further improved by experimental tests, and it is well agreed by both circuit and finite element method (FEM) simulation results.

abstract = {— Industry is adopting GaN HEMT in 10kW-100kW and higher power systems due to the ultra-fast switching capabilities of GaN. Paralleling GaN HEMT transistors is an appealing idea to further increase the power capability and reduce conduction losses of systems. The characteristics of E-mode GaN HEMT, such as positive temperature coefficient of RDS(ON) and a temperature independent threshold voltage, are very suitable for paralleling devices. However, the main challenge for parallel operation is thought to be the diverse parasitics of the power stage and gate driver circuits, which are very sensitive to the high di/dt and dv/dt during the switching process. In this paper, an analytic model for the switching process of paralleled GaN HEMT transistors is built to analyze the effects of parasitics and device characteristics on paralleling, and the design consideration for gate driver and layout is also presented. A half bridge power stage consisting of four high-side and four low-side 60 A / 650 V GaN HEMTs in parallel is designed to undertake 240 A / 400 V hard switching on and off. Double pulse testing results are presented to confirm GaN paralleling capability.},

abstract = {The requirements for driving gallium nitride (GaN) heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) and the design of a resonant drive circuit for GaN power HFET switches are discussed in this paper. The use of wideband III-nitride (such as GaN) devices today is limited to telecom and low-power applications. The current lack of high-frequency high-power drivers prevents their application in power converters. The proposed circuit is based upon resonant switching transition techniques, by means of an LC tag, to recover part of the power back into the voltage source in order to reduce the power loss. This circuit also uses level shifters to generate the zero and negative gate-source voltages required to turn the GaN HFET on and off, and it is highly tolerant to input-signal timing variances. The circuit reduces the overall power consumed in the driver and thus reduces the power loss. This is particularly important for high-frequency driver operation to take full advantage, in terms of efficiency, of the superior switching speed of GaN devices. In this paper, the topology of the low-power-loss high-speed drive circuit is introduced. Some simulation results and preliminary experimental measurements are discussed.},

This increase is a function of the applied DC bias when the device is in its OFF state, and the time which the device is biased for. Thus, dynamic R DS(on) of different commercial GaN-HEMTs are characterised at different bias voltages in the paper by a proposed new measurement circuit. The time- constants associated with trapping and detrapping effects in the device are extracted using the proposed circuit and it is shown that variations in R DS(on) can be predicted using a series of RC circuit networks. A new methodology for integrating these R DS(on) predictions into existing GaN-HEMT models in standard SPICE simulators to improve model accuracy is then presented. Finally, device dynamic R DS(on) values of the model is compared and validated with the measurement when it switches in a power converter with different duty cycles and switching voltages.},

GaN performance at elevated temperature is especially unique. Turn-on time increases significantly with temperature, and turn-on losses increase as a result. This phenomenon can be explained based on the relationships between junction temperature and GaN device transconductance, and between transconductance and turn-on time. An analytical relationship between temperature and turn-on loss has been derived for the 650-V GS66508 from GaN Systems, and verified with experimental results. Based on this relationship, a detailed model is developed, and a simplified scaling factor is proposed for estimating turn-on loss in e-mode GaN HFETs, using room-temperature switching characterization and typically published datasheet parameters.},

abstract = {-This paper designed the gate driver circuits and optimized the PCB layout in a 7.2kW battery charger using paralleled GaN HEMTs. 650V/60A enhancement mode GaN HEMTs provided by GaN Systems Inc are adopted. To optimize the switching performance of paralleled GaN HEMTs with low loss and high reliability, effects of parasitic inductance and capacitance are modeled and analyzed. Through cancelling the flux in the commutation loop, the power-loop parasitic inductance is reduced to only 0.7nH, which significantly decreases the electrical stress in the switch turn-off process. A diverse-parameter gate driver design has been proposed to achieve the reliable switching off. The Finite-Element-Analysis and Spice simulation show our current design could effectively suppress the voltage overshoot and gate-drive ringing on HEMTs. Experiments were carried out on both double pulse test platform and the 7.2kW charger to verify the proposed design strategy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a high-frequency high-efficiency GaN device-based interleaved critical current mode (CRM) bidirectional buck/boost converter with an inverse coupled inductor. The switching frequency is continually driven to megahertz range with GaN devices due to their small switching loss and driving loss, which greatly reduces the size of the passive components. The coupled inductor further reduces the core volume due to certain dc flux reductions. The equivalent inductance and the impact of the inverse coupled inductor on the CRM buck-boost converter are analyzed in detail. The resonant period in CRM is less with an inverse coupled inductor than with a noncoupled inductor, which is beneficial for the high-frequency operation. The soft-switching range and the circulating energy are both improved using an inverse coupled inductor in CRM. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis, and the coupled inductor prototype efficiency is 98.5{\%} at 1 MHz, which is 0.3{\%} higher than a prototype with a noncoupled inductor.},

abstract = {— The medium power rating two-level three phase voltage source inverter is among the most popular power conversion systems. The typical switching frequency of the commercial medium power rating inverter, however, is limited to tens of kHz. By increasing the switching frequency and using emerging gallium-nitride devices, the size of the overall system can be greatly reduced. This paper begins by reviewing all commercially available GaN power transistors and their package technologies. The GS66516T device from GaN Systems is selected due to its suitable ratings and superior package performance. Then, a half-bridge structure is designed for this device to achieve low parasitic inductance and strong cooling capability at the same time. The dynamic characterization results of this 650V/60A Enhancement-mode GaN transistor are extracted with the proposed half-bridge structure. A gate drive circuit with comprehensive protection function is integrated. Based on the proposed phase-leg structure, a 10 kW three phase inverter prototype is built and the experimental waveform is shown at the end.},

abstract = {Gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) are promising switching devices in high-efficiency and high-density dc-dc converters due to their fast switching speed and small conduction resistance. However, GaN HEMTs are very sensitive to parasitic inductance because of their high switching speed, low-threshold voltage, and small driving safety margin. Parasitic inductance can cause severe voltage overshoot and ringing, whichmay result in electromagnetic interference issues, false turnon, or even device breakdown. This paper aims at reducing the parasitic inductance (including power loop inductance and driver loop inductance) by optimizing the layout. First, a multiloop method is proposed to reduce the parasitic inductance. Optimization of both the conventional single-loop structure and the proposed multiloop structure are presented. Second, three kinds of power loop layouts based on the proposed multiloop structure are realized on PCB substrate and one of them is realized on aluminum nitride (AlN) substrate, which has higher thermal conductivity but less copper layers. The power loop inductance on PCB substrate is reduced to 0.1 nH, which is only 25{\%} of the state-of-art layout. The power loop inductance on AlN substrate is reduced to 0.22 nH. Third, the driver loop layout is optimized and achieves 50{\%} reduction of driver loop inductance compared with the conventional single-layer layout. Finally, integrated modules using the proposed layouts are built to validate the analyses and designs.},

abstract = {Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Transistor (GaN HEMT) is an emerging wide band gap power device in recent years. Using a cascoded structure, the GaN HEMT can be combined with a low voltage MOSFET to make the combination behave as a normally-off device. This paper investigates the soft-switching behavior of cascode GaN HEMT in the phase-leg structure. The analysis reveals some internal device behaviors during the soft-switching transition, which are not found in the non-cascode device. Due to the internal feedback of the cascode structure, the channel current of the internal GaN HEMT drops to zero quickly, leading to extremely low turn-off loss. However, it has been found that there are switching energy loss dissipated in the internal GaN HEMT during the turn-on transient, although the external waveforms of the cascode GaN HEMT exhibit zero voltage switching. The fundamental reason is that ratio of the sum of MOSFET output capacitance and internal GaN HEMT input capacitance to the internal GaN HEMT output capacitance is quite low. Based on the simulation, by adding additional capacitance on the gate source terminals of internal GaN HEMT, these losses can be mitigated. Experimental tests using a commercially available GaN device are presented which show nearly 400 mW of loss at 1 MHz switching frequency in four different load current conditions.},

abstract = {Power converters are complex devices subject to failures that can lead to undesired stops. For this reason, many fault-tolerant topologies and strategies have been deeply studied, mainly focusing on improving the electromechanical behavior of the reconfigured drive after the fault. However, it is also very important to evaluate the possible increase of power losses. In this paper, a power loss analysis is performed on a current-controlled three-phase inverter supplying a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (just chosen as an example), for all the operating modes, starting from the fault occurrence until the faulty operation mode is established. This is particularly important because the effectiveness of a fault-tolerant control strategy depends on the possibility to maintain a continuous operation. The latter is ensured only if there is no such increment of the losses that the survival of the component is at risk. The simulations are validated by means of experimental tests, and the results are discussed. The method can be easily applied to other topologies and reconfiguration strategies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. This paper analyzes the problem of instability in enhancement-mode gallium nitride (GaN) transistors based half-bridge circuits. The instability may cause sustained oscillation, resulting in overvoltage, excessive electromagnetic interference (EMI), and even device breakdown. GaN devices operate in the saturation region when they conduct reversely during the dead time. Under the influence of parasitic parameters, the GaN-based half-bridge circuit exhibits positive feedback under certain conditions, thus, resulting in sustained oscillation. A small-signal model is proposed to study this positive feedback phenomenon. Like the second-order under-damped system, damping ratio is defined to determine the system's stability. Based on the model, the influence of circuit parameters on instability is investigated and guidelines to suppress the oscillation are given. Reducing the co mmon-source inductance, increasing the gate resistance of the inactive switch or connecting a diode in parallel to the inactive switch are some effective ways to suppress the oscillation. Finally, the analyses are verified by both simulation and experiment.},

abstract = {An improved gate driver is presented which significantly lowers the output noise of high-precision switch-mode (Class-D) power amplifiers by reducing signal jitter at the output of the power stage tenfold to values below 20 ps. Gate signal jitter in power electronic converters, which introduces wideband noise to the power output, originates mainly from the signal isolators that are required to provide the galvanically isolated gate driver control signals. A low-jitter gate control signal is produced by employing a digital flip-flop, which uses a low-jitter isolated clock, to re-synchronize the jittery gate control signal. By utilizing the clock-enable input of the flip-flop, the gate driver can be rendered immune to high-speed common-mode transients, which is important as the Class-D power amplifier demonstrator system employs fast-switching GaN E-HEMT transistors, where the 400V switching transients exceed 300 kV $\mu$s?1. The signal to noise ratio of a sinusoidal output signal is measured at 107 dB, which is an improvement of 20 dB as compared to the performance of a conventional gate driver.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Gallium Nitride enhancement-mode high electron mobility transistors (GaN E-HEMTs) can achieve relatively high-efficiency and high-frequency in hard-switching mode. One particular reason is that GaN E-HEMTs obtain zero reverse-recovery loss and also a zero reverse-recovery period. For silicon (Si) MOSFETs, it has been a well-known issue that their Qrris too big to switch the transistor in hard-switching mode. Researchers have made extensive efforts to calculate the reverse-recovery loss. However, few of them pay attention to the Qoss, as the Qrrdominates in the turn-on switching loss for Si MOSFETs. For GaN HEMTs, the absence of the Qrrmakes the Qossnoticeable, although the value of the Qossfor GaN HEMTs is still the smallest among both Si and Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs. This paper focus on the Eqoss loss in GaN HEMTs. The Eqoss loss mechanism, detailed calculation and detailed measurement method for GaN HEMTs are provided. In addition, the theoretical results are verified by the double-pulse test at different junction temperatures and gate resistances.},

@article{Zhao2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.In this paper, we carried out an analysis of the breakdown characterization method by the investigation on off-state leakage currents and breakdown curves. For conventional breakdown, seven kinds of breakdown curves are summarized and it is found that only two of them can be shown by the conventional three-terminal breakdown characterization method reasonably. For the other five kinds of breakdown curves, the value of the gate leakage current is larger than that of the drain leakage current for a certain drain-bias range. Besides, the source leakage current cannot represent the buffer leakage current, and the values and signs of them are different. These problems contradict the conventional characterization method, indicating that the conventional method should be modified to characterize the breakdown mechanisms correctly. The similar problems also exist for time-dependent breakdown. The buffer and drain-gate leakage currents were obtained by a simple method and the conventional breakdown characterization method was modified by using these two currents. The problems in the conventional breakdown characterization method are solved by using the modified method. Experiments indicate that the modified breakdown characterization method is crucial to investigate the breakdown mechanisms, especially when source-gate leakage current cannot be neglected compared with the buffer leakage current.},

GaN devices will benefit many applications such as hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles, solar power inverters, industrial motor drives, and aerospace.

abstract = {Compared with the state-of-the-art Si-based power devices, enhancement-mode Gallium Nitride (E-mode GaN) transistors have better figures of merit and exhibit great potential in enabling higher switching frequency, higher efficiency, and higher power density for power converters. The bridge-leg configuration circuit, consisting of a controlling switch and a synchronous switch, is a critical component in many power converters. However, owing to the low threshold voltage and fast switching speed, E-mode GaN devices are more prone to false turn-on phenomenon in bridge-leg configuration, leading to undesirable results, such as higher switching loss, circuit oscillation, and shoot through. In order to expand gate terminal's safe operating margin without increasing reverse conduction loss during deadtime, negative gate voltage bias for turn-off and antiparallel diode could be applied to E-mode GaN device. In this paper, with consideration of strong nonlinearities in C-V and I-V characteristics of high-voltage (650 V) E-mode GaN transistors, analytical device models are first developed. Then, we develop an analytical circuit model that combines the circuit parameters with intrinsic characteristics of the high-voltage GaN transistor and antiparallel diode. Thus, key transient waveforms with regard to the false turn-on problem can be acquired, including displacement current and false triggering voltage pulse on gate terminal. The simulated waveforms are then verified on a testing board with GaN-based bridge-leg circuit. In contrast to piece-wise switching process models and PSpice simulation, the proposed model exhibits outstanding performances. To provide design guidelines for mitigating false turn-on of GaN transistor, the impacts of different circuit parameters, along with the optimum negative gate voltage bias, are investigated based on the proposed model.},

abstract = {Gallium-Nitride power transistors have a limited short-circuit withstand time, which can be as low as 200 ns. Typical short-circuit detection methods such as the desaturation detection method and current based methods present difficulties when they are applied to Gallium Nitride devices. The former requires a blanking time and therefore can detect a short-circuit at a relatively late stage, this method also reacts slowly under high-inductive short circuits. Current based methods require either a special transistor with a current mirror or a special package with a Kelvin connection. This work presents the use of a current sensor integrated into a printed circuit board to perform a very fast short-circuit detection. Two detection methods using the integrated current sensor were implemented, which neither use a blanking time nor require a special transistor package. The functioning under both Hard Switch Fault and Fault Under Load types of short circuit was experimentally tested and a resulting short circuit detection time as low as 30 ns is demonstrated.},

abstract = {In this paper, the short-circuit (SC) performance of two different SiC MOSFETs is experimentally investigated for different input voltages, biasing voltages and case temperatures. The measurement results are compared to simulations, and a good agreement is achieved. For fault handling, two different overcurrent protection (OCP) circuits are designed and applied to the SiC MOSFETs. The desaturation method is successfully tested with a hardware solution substituting the blanking time delay. The second method is based on sensing the voltage drop across the parasitic inductance at the source pin. The experimental and simulation results show that both OCP methods have the capability to detect a short circuit condition in the SiC MOSFET within safe SC time avoiding device failure.},

abstract = {A fast overcurrent protection scheme was developed for GaN gate injection transistors (GITs), harnessing the relationship between the externally measured vgs and id in steady-state operation. This relationship has been characterized in both static and dynamic testing over a wide range of operating conditions, and a circuit has been constructed to implement this control scheme. The circuit uses analog components to integrate the protection feature into a commercially available GIT gate driver. The scheme was experimentally verified in a double pulse test setup for experimental verification, and its total fault response time was recorded at less than 70 ns, with 400 V dc bus and a 30 A threshold. Compared with conventional desaturation protection, which detects faults based on drain voltage rather than gate voltage, the proposed scheme offers benefits in terms of speed, temperature invariance, flexibility in threshold selection, and minimal impact on the GIT's normal switching behavior.},

abstract = {Gallium Nitride enhancement-mode high electron mobility transistors (GaN E-HEMTs) are being designed into power electronic systems due to the fast switching capability. The GaN-based converters obtain higher efficiency, smaller size, and lower cost from the system point of view. On the other hand, the fast-switching characteristic of GaN also introduces the challenge of the short-circuit protection (SCP) and over-current protection (OCP). The traditional SCP/OCP methods are either too slow or not practical to the GaN device. Therefore, an alternative SCP/OCP solution which is fast and easy to implement is much desired for GaN HEMT. In this paper, an ultrafast discrete circuit of SCP for GaN HEMTs is proposed. The protection method includes two stages. The first-stage is soft turn-off, and the second-stage is hard turn-off. The soft turn-off can reduce the gate voltage gradually and thus limit the voltage spike on the DC-link. The method has been verified by both SPICE simulation and hardware implementation. The implementation results show that the propagation delay time for first-stage and second-stage are 85 ns and 125 ns, respectively. As a result, the proposed circuit is able to protect GaN HEMTs for short-circuit scenario under different DC-link voltages.},

abstract = {As a promising next generation power switch, Gallium nitride (GaN) has a high power rating and broad application capabilities; however, the protection method on a GaN phase leg has recently become an urgent topic. This paper discusses shortcircuit protection on a paralleled GaN phase leg. It begins with a discussion on device static characterization and how desaturation detection can be transferred to a paralleled GaN phase leg. Desaturation detection implementation is then described, using a commercial gate driver IC. Lastly, the results of both the shortcircuit protection, and the Miller clamp test on a paralleled GaN phase leg, are presented.},

@article{Dusmez2018,
abstract = {With GaN devices, power electronics designers are now able to push the switching frequency of their designs to levels not possible with today's Si MOSFETs. Higher switching frequencies reduce the size of passive components in the system and in turn increase the overall power density. To make these solutions robust, protection against overcurrent events is needed. Traditional approaches using current sense transformer, shunt resistors, or de-saturation detection circuits remain ineffective due to slow response time. These techniques may also adversely affect the system performance by adding parasitic inductances and resistances in the power loop that may require slowing down GaN switching speed or cause additional power losses in the system. To solve this challenge, TI's LMG341X family of GaN power stages provide an integrated OCP function. This high-speed feature can turn off the GaN FET in less than 100-ns in an overcurrent or short-circuit event. This application note explains the importance of this feature as well as "latched" or "cycle-by-cycle" modes of operation.},

@article{Reusch2016,
abstract = {Gallium nitride (GaN) based power devices are rapidly being adopted due to their ability to operate at frequencies and switching speeds beyond the capability of silicon (Si) power MOSFETs. In this application note, we will discuss paralleling high speed GaN transistors in applications requiring higher output current. This work will discuss the impact of in-circuit parasitics on performance and propose printed circuit board (PCB) layout methods to improve parallel performance of high speed GaN transistors. Four parallel half bridges in an optimized layout operated as a 48 V to 12 V, 480 W, 300 kHz, 40 A single phase buck converter achieving eeciencies above 96.5{\%} from 35{\%} to 100{\%} load will be demonstrated. Power converters are constantly trending towards higher output power, higher eeciency, higher power density, higher temperature operation, and higher reliability, all while providing a lower overall system cost. To provide improved performance better power devices are required. For silicon (Si) power devices, the gains in performance have slowed as the technology has matured and approaches its theoretical limits. Gallium nitride (GaN) transistors have emerged as a possible replacement for silicon devices in various power conversion applications and as an enabler of new applications not previously possible [1]. Since the rst commercially available enhancement mode gallium nitride transistors were launched in 2010, eGaN FETs have had extremely low on-resistance in an extremely small footprint compared with any previously available semiconductor. As shown in gure 1, eGaN FETs are continuing this tradition with the latest generations of GaN devices, which have a lateral device structure and voltages ranging from 15-300 V. At 200 V, the eGaN FET has a speciic on-resistance, which is the product of the device area and on-resistance, 9.5 times lower than the best state of the art MOSFET. At voltages of 100 V, 80 V, 60 V, and 40 V, eGaN FETs provide respective speciic on-resistance reductions of 2.4, 2.2, 1.6, and 1.05 times that of the best state of the art MOSFETs. GaN technology, in its early stages, is far from its theoretical limit [1] and the rate of improvement in GaN has been, and will continue to be rapid. While reducing the speciic on-resistance of a transistor can increase the amount of current that can be conducted in a given area, it does not directly correlate to superior in-circuit performance, especially for high frequency power converter design where switching losses are often the dominant loss mechanism. Switching gures of merit (FOM) [2]-[8] have been used for almost half a century to compare the in-circuit performance capability of a given device technology in diierent applications. A popular FOM is the gate charge FOM [6], which is shown in gure 2 for eGaN FETs and state of the art MOSFETs. At voltages of 200 V, 100 V, and 40 V, eGaN FETs provide respective speciic on-resistance reductions of 9, 5.5, and 1.9 times that of the best state of the art MOSFETs. There are various FOMs derived for diierent applications such as hard-switching applications and resonant and soft-switching applications [9].},
