abstract = {We present a decentralized control strategy that yields switch interleaving for parallel-connected dc-dc buck converters. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that are distributed at best, the proposed architecture requires no communication, and hence, presents a variety of advantages with regard to reliability, modularity, and cost. The method is based on the digital implementation of the dynamics of a Li{\'{e}}nard-type oscillator circuit as the controller for the converters. Each controller only requires the locally measured output current to synthesize the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) carrier waveform. The intrinsic electrical coupling between converters drives the nonlinear-oscillator-based controllers to converge to an interleaved state with uniform phase spacing across PWM carriers, independent of the number of converters, the load, and initial conditions. We provide analytical guarantees for existence and stability of the interleaved state as well as extensive hardware results for a system of five 120 W 48 V-to-12 V dc-dc buck converters that demonstrate convergence to the interleaved state in the face of a variety of large-signal disturbances.},

abstract = {A new family of non-isolated zero current transition bi-directional
converters is introduced. Basic non-isolated bi-directional DC-DC
converters are derived by combining basic DC-DC converters and they are
able to transfer energy between two DC sources using two main switches.
In the proposed bi-directional converters, instead of using two
independent auxiliary circuits for each main switch, same components
with a single auxiliary switch is used to provide soft commutation at
both modes of converter operation. In addition, the soft switching range
in the proposed converters is not dependent on the duty cycle and the
auxiliary circuit is applied only once in each switching cycle, which
leads to a simple control circuit. Low weight, small volume, high
efficiency and the ease of control are the most important benefits of
the proposed converters. The proposed bi-directional buck and boost
converter is fully analysed for both buck and boost operating modes. The
validity of theoretical analysis is justified using experimental results
of a 200 W, 50-100 V prototype converter.},

abstract = {This paper investigates an approach for achieving zero-voltage switching of an interleaved bi-directional buck-boost converter over a wide input-output voltage operating range by utilizing a coupled inductor with a variable coupling coefficient. The approach is based on regulating the value of the coupling coefficient by means of a direct current depending on the converter conversion ratio, thereby controlling the amplitude and duration of the resonant voltage transition. The impact of the controllable value of the coupling coefficient on the equivalent inductance, the zero-voltage transition period, and the resonant amplitude is analyzed in detail by applying analytical modeling. In comparison to the converter with a fixed coupled inductor operating over a wide input-output voltage span, the variable coupled inductor significantly improves the soft-switching range and reduces the circulating energy. Outside of the controllable resonant amplitude region, the converter with a variable coupled inductor still achieves reduction in the duration of the resonant transition period. To validate theoretical analysis, experimental results are recorded on the gallium nitride interleaved bi-directional buck-boost converter prototype. Improvements in efficiency at both full and half loads in comparison to the prototype with a fixed coupled inductor are achieved.},

abstract = {Active resonant tank (ART) cells are proposed in this paper to achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) and eliminate body-diode conduction in dc-dc converters with synchronous rectifiers (SRs). In low-output-voltage dc-dc converters, SRs are widely utilized to reduce rectifier conduction loss and improve converter efficiency. However, during switches' transition, SRs' parasitic body diodes unavoidably carry load current, which decreases conversion efficiency because voltage drop across body diodes is much higher than that across SRs. Moreover, body diodes' reverse recovery leads to increased switching losses and electromagnetic interference. With the proposed cells of an ART, the body diode conduction of the SR is eliminated during the switching transition from a SR to an active switch, and thus body diode reverse-recovery-related switching and ringing losses are saved. An ART cell consists of a LC resonant tank and an auxiliary switch. A resonant tank cell is charged in a resonant manner and energy is stored in the capacitor of the tank. Prior to a switching transition from a SR to an active switch, the energy stored in the tank capacitor is released and converted to inductor current, which forces the SR current changes direction to avoid conduction of the body diode and related reverse recovery when the SR turns off. Moreover, at the help of energy released from the ART, the active switch's junction capacitance is discharged, which allows the active switch turns on at ZVS. Since energy commutation occurs only during switching transition, conduction loss in the ART cell is limited. Moreover, the auxiliary switch turns off at ZVS and the SR operates at ZVS.

abstract = {A high-efficiency bidirectional dc-dc converter with low circulating current and zero-voltage switching (ZVS) characteristic throughout a full range of loads is proposed. In the proposed converter, an auxiliary circuit consisting of an inductor, two switches, and four diodes is utilized for achieving high efficiency regardless of the load. At medium and heavy loads, ZVS of main switches is achieved by appropriate energy stored in the auxiliary inductor. Since the energy stored in the auxiliary inductor varies in accordance with loads, the conduction loss can be minimized. At light load, ZVS of main switches can be achieved without the help of the auxiliary circuit. Therefore, the auxiliary circuit stays inactive so that conduction loss can be minimized. Consequently, the conduction loss which is associated with ZVS of main switches is minimized while ZVS of main switches is achieved throughout a full range of loads. The proposed converter shows high efficiency since the switching loss is significantly reduced due to ZVS operation of main switches without severe increase of the conduction loss. Compared with a conventional hard-switching bidirectional dc-dc converter, the efficiency is improved about 3.1{\%} in boost mode (2.76{\%} in buck mode) at full load. In order to verify the performance of the proposed converter, experimental results from a 200-W prototype are presented. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present a decentralized control strategy that yields switch interleaving for parallel-connected dc-dc buck converters. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that are distributed at best, the proposed architecture requires no communication, and hence, presents a variety of advantages with regard to reliability, modularity, and cost. The method is based on the digital implementation of the dynamics of a Li{\'{e}}nard-type oscillator circuit as the controller for the converters. Each controller only requires the locally measured output current to synthesize the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) carrier waveform. The intrinsic electrical coupling between converters drives the nonlinear-oscillator-based controllers to converge to an interleaved state with uniform phase spacing across PWM carriers, independent of the number of converters, the load, and initial conditions. We provide analytical guarantees for existence and stability of the interleaved state as well as extensive hardware results for a system of five 120 W 48 V-to-12 V dc-dc buck converters that demonstrate convergence to the interleaved state in the face of a variety of large-signal disturbances.},

abstract = {Good understanding of power loss in a high frequency synchronous buck converter is important for design optimization of both discrete and system level. Most of the power losses are relatively easy to quantify. The exception is the power loss associated with Cdv/dt induced turn on of the low-side metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (synchronous rectifier). This paper characterizes the Cdv/dt induced power loss in two ways. First, detailed device characterization, in-circuit testing, and modeling are used for a comparative loss calculation. This method offers detailed loss breakdown but requires specialized test equipment and is rather complicated and time consuming. A simple method is then introduced to accurately quantify the Cdv/dt loss. With this method, the Cdv/dt induced power loss on synchronous buck converters at different operation conditions can be readily assessed. The impacts of Cdv/dt induced loss on different applications are addressed. Finally, the design tradeoffs at both discrete and system levels are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

This paper addresses design and implementation of monolithic GaN half-bridge power stages with integrated gate drivers optimized for pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) dc-dc converters operating at 100 MHz switching frequency. Three gate-driver circuit topologies are considered for integration with half-bridge power stages in a 0.15-$\mu$ depletion-mode GaN-on-SiC process: an active pull-up driver, a bootstrapped driver, and a novel modified active pull-up driver. An analytical loss model is developed and used to optimize the monolithic GaN chips, which are then used to construct 20 V, 5 W, 100 MHz synchronous buck converter prototypes. With the bootstrapped and the modified pull-up gate-driver circuits, power stage efficiencies above 91{\%} and total efficiencies close to 88{\%} are demonstrated. The modified active pull-up driver, which offers 80{\%} reduction in the driver area, is found to be the best-performing approach in the depletion-mode GaN process.

When designing an AC to DC converter for a DC nano-grid system, the grounding configuration, which determines the costs, the efficiency as well as the safety, plays an important role. A three-terminal output AC to DC converter based on united grounding configuration has been presented for DC nano-grid. However, it has to be pointed out that the three-terminal output DC nano-grid is not as popular as the two-terminal DC output one, due to the infrastructure consideration. This paper proposes a new Buck-Boost AC to DC converter with two-terminal output voltage for DC nano-grid. The operating principle, the steady-state analysis, and the small signal modelling for the proposed converter working in continuous conduction mode are presented in detail. A 220 V/50 Hz/800 W prototype was fabricated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed converter.},

Future aircraft power distribution systems will also very likely include energy storage devices (probably, batteries) for emergency back up and engine starting. Correspondingly, novel DC-DC conversion solutions are required, which can interface the traditional low voltage (28 V) DC bus with the new 270 V one. Such solutions presently need to cater for a significant degree of flexibility in their power ratings, power transfer capability and number of inputs/outputs. Specifically, multi-port power-scalable bi-directional converters are required.

This work presents a thorough review of several topologies of bidirectional DC-DC power converters that are considered good candidates to meet certain important aeronautic requirements, as those related with high efficiency and high power density. We perform simulations on virtual prototypes, constructed by using detailed component models, and optimized following design criteria that are in accordance with those typically imposed by aeronautic requirements. This comparative analysis is aimed to clearly identify the advantages and drawbacks of each topology, and to relate them with the required voltage and power levels.

The proposed configuration is composed of threewinding coupled inductors, voltage multiplier cells and a clamp circuit. The step-up voltage gain is effectively increased, owing to the voltage-stack and voltage-lift techniques using the voltage multiplier cells. The leakage inductor energy is recycled by the clamp circuit to avoid the voltage surge on a power switch. The low-voltage-rated power switches with low on-state resistances and costs can be used to decrease the conduction losses and increase the conversion efficiency when the voltage stresses of power switches for the converter are considerably lower than the high output voltage. The reverse-recovery problems of diodes are mitigated by the leakage inductances of the coupled inductors. Moreover, both the input current ripple and the current stress on each power switch are reduced, owing to the interleaved operation. The operating principle and steady-state analysis of the proposed converter are thoroughly presented herein. A controller network is designed to diminish the effect of the variations of input voltage and output load on the output voltage.

abstract = {This article proposes a holistic codesign optimization framework (COF) to simultaneously optimize a power conversion stage and a controller stage using a dual-loop control scheme for multiphase SiC-based DC/DC converters. In this study, the power conversion stage adopts a non-isolated interleaved boost converter (IBC). Besides, the dual-loop control scheme uses type-III controllers for both inner- and outer- loops to regulate the output voltage of the IBC and tackle its non-minimum phase issue. Based on the converter architecture, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem including four objective functions (OFs) is properly formulated for the COF. To this end, total input current ripple, total weight of inductors and total power losses are selected as three OFs for the power conversion stage whilst one OF called integral of time-weighted absolute error is considered for the controller stage. The OFs are expressed in analytical forms. To solve the MOO problem, the COF utilizes a non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) in combination with an automatic decision-making algorithm to obtain the optimal design solution including the number of phases, switching frequency, inductor size, and the control parameters of type-III controllers. Furthermore, compared to the conventional ‘k-factor' based controller, the optimal controller exhibits better dynamic responses in terms of undershoot/overshoot and settling time for the output voltage under load disturbances. Moreover, a liquid-cooled SiC-based converter is prototyped and its optimal controller is implemented digitally in dSPACE MicroLabBox. Finally, the experimental results with static and dynamic tests are presented to validate the outcomes of the proposed COF.},

To further the role of EVs in the market, more efficient power electronic converters are needed. Wide band gap (WBG) devices such as silicon carbide (SiC) provide higher frequency and lower power loss, however, their high di/dt and dv/dt transients result in higher electromagnetic interference (EMI). On the other hand, some gate driver parameters such as gate resistor (RG) have a contradictory effect on efficiency ($\eta$) and EMI. The idea of this paper is to investigate the values of these parameters using a multi-objective optimization method to optimize $\eta$ and EMI at the same time. To this aim, first, the effect of high and low side RG on $\eta$ and EMI in the half-bridge configuration is studied. Then, the objective functions of the optimization problem are obtained using a numerical regression method on the basis of the experimental tests. Then, the values of the gate resistors are obtained by solving the multi-objective optimization problem. Finally, $\eta$ and EMI of the converter in the optimum gate resistor design are compared to those in the conventional design to validate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.},

@article{VanDeSande2020,
abstract = {The operational expenditures of solar energy are gaining attention because of the continuous decrease of the capital expenditures. This creates a demand for more reliable systems to further decrease the costs. Increased reliability is often ensured by iterative use of design for reliability. The number of iterations that can take place strongly depends on the computational efficiency of this methodology. The main research objective is to quantify the influence of the temperature dependence of the electrical variables used in the electro-thermal model on the reliability and the computation time. The influence on the reliability is evaluated by using a 2-D finite elements method model of the MOSFET and calculating the plastic energy dissipation density in the die-attach and the bond wire. The trade-off between computation time of the electro-thermal model in PLECS (4.3, Plexim, Zurich, Switzerland) and generated plastic energy accuracy obtained in COMSOL (5.3, COMSOL Inc., Burlington, MA, USA) is reported when excluding a certain temperature dependence. The results indicate that the temperature dependence of the input and output capacitors causes no change in the plastic energy dissipated in the MOSFET but does introduce the largest increase in computation time. However, not including the temperature dependence of the MOSFET itself generates the largest difference in plastic energy of 10{\%} as the losses in the die are underestimated.},

@article{Waradzyn2020,
abstract = {This paper presents a concept for the operation of a resonant DC–DC switched-capacitor converter with very high efficiency and output voltage regulation. In its basic concept, such a converter operates as a switched-capacitor voltage doubler (SCVD) in the Zero Current Switching (ZCS) mode with a constant output voltage. The proposed methods of switching allow for the switched-capacitor (SC) converter output voltage regulation, and improve its efficiency by the operation with Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS). In this paper, various switching patterns are proposed to achieve high efficiency and the output voltage control by frequency or duty cycle regulation. Some examples of the application of the proposed switching patterns are presented: in current control at the start-up of the converter, in a bi-directional converter, and in a modular cascaded system. The paper also presents an analytical model as well as the relationships between the switching frequency, voltage ratio and efficiency. Further, it demonstrates the experimental verification of the waveforms, voltage ratios, as well as efficiency. The proposed experimental setup achieved a maximum efficiency of 99.228{\%}. The implementation of the proposed switching patterns with the ZVS operation along with the GaN-based (Gallium Nitride) design, with a planar choke, leads to a high-efficiency and low-volume solution for the SCVD converter and is competitive with the switch-mode step-up converters.},

@article{Frivaldsky2020,
abstract = {In this article, the practical comparison of the operational performance of the modular (or multiport) and non-modular bidirectional buck/boost (bi-BB) DC/DC converter is realized. The main contribution of the work is the evaluation of both concepts based on various aspects, considering the qualitative indicators of the systems relevant for microgrids. Here, we discuss efficiency, electrical properties, costs, and component values. At the same time, critical comparisons are provided for converters based on SiC and GaN technology (non-modular high-voltage SiC- based dual-interleaved converter and modular low-voltage GaN-based). The concepts are specific with their operating frequency, whereby for each solution, the switching frequency is different and directly influences relevant components. The efficiency, overall system volume, output voltage ripple, and input current ripple are compared mutually between both concepts with a dependency on power delivery. These factors, together with overall volume and costs, are very important considering modern converters for microgrid systems. The summary of pros and cons is realized for each of the proposed converters, whereby the evaluation criterion is reflected within the electrical properties targeting microgrid application.},
