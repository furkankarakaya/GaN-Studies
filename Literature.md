## Structure - General Characteristics
#### GaN Transistors for Efficient Power Conversion. (2014). https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118844779
* Crystal structure also gives GaN **piezoelectric properties** that lead to its ability to achieve very high
conductivity compared with other semiconductor materials. Piezoelectricity in GaN is predominantly caused
by the displacement of charged elements in the crystal lattice. If the lattice is subjected to strain,
 the deformation will cause a miniscule shift in the atoms in the lattice that generate an electric field –
  the higher the strain, the greater the electric field. By growing a thin layer of AlGaN on top of a GaN
   crystal, a strain is created at the interface that induces a compensating two- dimensional electron gas
    (2DEG).
</br>![](images/GaNwurtzite.png?raw=true)

* When a negative voltage relative to both drain and source electrodes is applied to the gate,
 the electrons in the 2DEG are depleted out of the device. This type of transistor is called a
 depletion-mode, or **d-mode**, HEMT. **Normally ON**
</br>![](images/GaNDMode.png?raw=true)

* A **D-Mode** GaN structure can be implemented with Schottky Gate or with a Metal Gate with insulator like
MOSFETs.
</br>![](images/GaNDMode2.png?raw=true)

* An **enhancement-mode (e-mode)** device, on the other hand, would not suffer this limitation.
 With zero bias on the gate, an e-mode device is **OFF**. There are four popular structures that have been used to create enhancement-mode devices:
recessed gate, implanted gate, pGaN gate, and cascode hybrid.
* **Implanted Gate**
</br>![](images/GaNEModeFlorin.png?raw=true)

* **p-GaN Gate**:
The positive charges in this pGaN layer have a built-in voltage that is larger than the voltage generated by the piezoelectric effect,
 thus depleting the electrons in the 2DEG and creating an enhancement-mode structure
</br>![](images/GaNEModepgan.png?raw=true)

* **Cascode**:
A Si MOSFET is placed in series with a D-mode HEMT device

* When the GaN layer exceeds ECrit (GaN), a different mechanism causes device failure. When breakdown occurs in the GaN or Al GaN regions,
 the electrons generated can destroy the 2DEG, causing the device on-resistance to increase greatly:
 ** Breakdown causes open circuit**

* Because the strain in the AlGaN barrier is relatively constant with temperature, as are the
voltages generated by the internal metallurgy, the **threshold voltage** in a GaN HEMT is relatively
**constant with temperature**

* The reason for the drop in **capacitance** as **VDS** increases is that the free electrons in the GaN are
 depleted. For example, the initial step down in COSS is caused by the depletion of the 2DEG near the
 surface. Higher VDS values extend the depletion region laterally from the field plate edge to the drain,
  further depleting the 2DEG and eliminating its capacitive component
</br>![](images/GaNCapacitanceSource.png?raw=true)

* The QGD and QGS are also specified separately because they impact the voltage- and current-
switching transition speeds, respectively. Also, the ratio of these two values, **QGD/QGS, called
the Miller ratio,** is often an important metric to determine the point at which a device might turn
on due to a voltage transient applied across the drain and source.

Switching Transient Analysis for Normally-Off GaN Transistors with p-GaN Gate in a Phase-Leg Circuit.
 IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, PP(c), 1–1. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2018.2852142

* Owing to the p-GaN layer inserted between the gate electrode and the AlGaN barrier, **a p-GaN/gate-metal Schottky junction (J1)
 and a p-GaN/AlGaN heterojunction (J2)** would be formed. when a high drain-to-gate stress (Vdg-stress) is applied, where J1 is forward
 biased while J2 is reversely biased. As a result, the holes in p-GaN layer are more prone to enter into the gate electrode.
 Once the drain voltage stress is removed, because of J1’s low reverse leakage current,
 the removed positive charges in p-GaN could not be quickly recovered [23], leading to a
 **positive shift in Vth**.
 </br>![](images/GaNGateJunctions.png?raw=true)

* During the switching transient process, the depletion region of Schottky junction J1 would be widened because of the
removed holes in p-GaN layer [23]. Therefore, both the Schottky junction J1 and heterojunction J2 would be reversely biased.
 Taking J1 as an example, during a switching period, the charging/discharging current of intrinsic capacitance C1 would
  be 1.5~1.9x104 times higher than its leakage current (0.4A~0.6A vs. 21.1µA~39.3µA). Consequently, **the diode would not
   be taken into consideration in the circuit-level analysis**, on account of the dominant role played by capacitance’s displacement current.

* At the interface between these two layers, a layer of high-mobility electrons called “two-dimensional electron gas” (2DEG) forms as a result of the **crystal polarity**, and is also augmented by **piezoelectric crystal strain** due to the **lattice mismatch between AlGaN and GaN**.

* When this voltage exceeds the **threshold voltage Vgd,th**, which is typically **approximately the same as the specified Vgs,th**, the e-mode device channel will turn on and allow reverse current to flow.

* The voltage drop in the SCRC mode will then be, eqn, where Rsd,rev is the effective channel resistance during SCRC. Rsd,rev is typically higher than Rds,on and varies with Tj , Vgs, and Id.
</br>![](images/GaNReverseDrop.png?raw=true)

* **Current collapse** has been a widely reported phenomenon
for lateral GaN devices, causing a temporary increase in ON-resistance that is proportional to blocking voltage. The first is the **trapping of surface charges near the drain edge of the gate terminal** when the device is in its OFF-state. During the following ON-state, these trapped charges act as a virtual gate, weakening the 2DEG until they are released. The second mechanism is **the injection of hot electrons into even deeper traps within the device**, particularly in traps caused by carbon doping in the buffer layer. These trapped charges weaken the 2DEG and increase Rds,on,and may also cause **long-term degradation** to the device.

* **Source and gate field plates** help to redistribute the gate–drain **electric field away from the gate edge**.
</br>![](images/GaNplate.png?raw=true)

* **Steady-state gate current** is expected during normal operation **for e-mode HFETs with p-doped gate caps**.

* The **threshold voltage** of most GaN devices is relatively **stable over temperature**.

Energy Energy Manag., no. May, pp. 16–18, 2017.

* We begin with the **gate lag** phenomenon, which concerns rather traps behaviour under the gate. It can explain the dispersion of the threshold voltage.

* There is a remarkable dispersion qualitatively and quantitatively. This is
noticed on the time
constants that **reflects dispersion in the traps activation energies, and also on their amplitude, which reflects dispersion in their density**. On the other hand, we notice a qualitative increase and/or decrease in each curve, which may **reveals the existence of traps in AlGaN and GaN layer simultaneously**. These traps may have contradictory effects on the 2DEG concentration whether they are located in GaN or AlGaN layer.

* We performed the same study on the **drain lag.** To this end, we applied a drain voltage of 600 V in the OFF-State for 1 s and 1 V in the ON-State in order to activate the maximum of trap energy levels. In the following we present the transient currents that illustrate the dispersion between the components at the level of the drain traps.

* We note a different behavior compared to the Gate Lag. **The current collapses at the beginning, due to the effect of
the high
voltage applied during the OFF-state**, which depletes totally the channel.

* Also note that most devices may **take a very long time to return to their initial state**, **even** on this time scale, we find that
**there are some
devices that have not yet stabilized.**

* One of the factors that yield **the saturation current reduction
is due to the temperature-dependent transconductance in the 2DEG channel** of GaN HEMT. Clearly, with higher junction temperature, the saturation current gets lower.

* The second factor that contributes to the saturation current
reduction can be on the gate. It has been proven that **the fast increase of the temperature has an effect on the gate current** [9]. **With a higher temperature, the gate current becomes higher**. Therefore, it introduces **a larger voltage drop on the gate**. This can be another reason cause the saturation current reduction.

*  The **main problems of the available GaN cascodes** are related to **its packaging**, which, in combination with control and power loop inductances, is responsible for the observed gate ringing. **Under a SC event** in a real application, this **ringing could lead to the device destruction** or converter failure, even after withstanding such an electrical stress. In this regard, gate bipolar control and reducing loop inductances could assist to improve cascodes SC ruggedness. Moreover, the **low thermal self-regulation** on their gate control **makes them less rugged than EHEMTs to SC events**. However, **GaN cascodes present an inherent pn- junction structure at the Si MOSFET, which can be used as a free-wheeling diode with a significantly lower forward voltage** (integral diode +DHEMT) drop than EHEMTs. This is of interest for synchronous rectification, e.g., power inverters for motor driving. As another benefit, **GaN cascodes can be controlled using traditional VG values**.

## Modelling

#### GaN Transistors for Efficient Power Conversion. (2014). https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118844779
* The **voltage overshoot damping** rate is dependent on the **skin and proximity effect** losses at the ringing frequency.
To **approximate** this, a **parallel damping resistance of 1Ω** is placed across each of the parasitic
inductance elements.

* The **plateau voltage** is where the current crosses Vgs at specific Vds values.
</br>![](images/GaNIdsvsVgsTemp.png?raw=true)

## Switching / Loss Characterization

#### GaN Transistors for Efficient Power Conversion. (2014). https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118844779
* It is often very convenient to look at the amount of charge necessary to change the voltage across
various terminals in the GaN HEMT.
* **QGS:** Charge required to increase gate voltage from zero to the plateau voltage.
</br>**QGS1:**
Charge required to increase gate voltage from zero to the threshold voltage of the device.
</br>**QGS2:**
Charge required to commutate the device current.
</br>**QGS = QGS1 + QGS2**</br>
**QGD:**
Charge required to commutate the device voltage, at which point the device enters the linear region.
</br>**QG:** Total gate charge required to drive a device from zero to rated gate voltage, including QGD
</br>![](images/GaNGateCharge.png?raw=true)

* **Self-commutation transitions have zero POSS losses**, but only **if the load current is sufficient** to completely
 charge COSS to VBUS or discharge to zero, and if the time to complete the self-commutation transition
  is much longer than the current transition time of the device itself.
* During a current transition event, the **voltage generated across the common source inductance will
 oppose the gate voltage**, thereby reducing the gate current used to charge the gate capacitance.
 This effectively **lengthens the current transition period**.

* The **power loop inductance** has two main **negative effects** on the switch during turn-off: it
**slows the transition** and it **increases the voltage across the drain and source**. During device turn- on,
 the loop inductance reduces the device drain-to-source voltage, which decreases losses. However,
  the sum of the two negative effects and the positive effect has a net negative result, which means
  that the loop inductance will increase losses in the circuit

* The **switching performance of the cascode device** relies heavily on the **parasitic inductances** in the package, especially between the two dies, and also on how well the junction capacitances of the two are matched. If the **inductances are too high**, or the **capacitances are not matched** well, the switching **losses can increase** significantly.

* **In hard-switched converters**, the two significant sources of
switching energy losses are the **energy related to stored charge in the output capacitors (Coss loss)** and the **loss from conduction of the load current through a saturated device channel (overlap loss)**.



## Parasitics

#### Jones, E. A., Wang, F. F., & Costinett, D. (2016). Review of Commercial GaN Power Devices and GaN-Based Converter Design Challenges. IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics, 4(3), 707–719. https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2016.2582685

* Some devices provide a Kelvin source connection, which is a separate connection to the source metallization that is only used by the gate loop, decoupling it more effectively from power loop transient effects [65]–[68].

## Gate Driver Design

#### GaN Transistors for Efficient Power Conversion. (2014). https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118844779

* To critically damp this loop, the overall **gate loop resistance** RG(eq) (RG(eq) =RG +RSource
) must be larger than the value given in Equation 3.1. This is achieved by minimizing
the gate loop inductance (LG) and adjusting the series gate resistance to limit overshoot.
$R_g(eq) >= sqrt{4*L_g/C_gs}$

* Since the **turn-on and turn-off damping requirements** are different, the minimum gate loop
resistance values will also differ. These differences are best addressed by separating the
pull-up and pull-down gate driver resistances at the driver output (creating two separate driver
outputs), thus allowing the use of two separate gate resistors to independently adjust the turn-on
 and turn- off gate loop damping.

* The concern is that, unless addressed, the charging current through the CGD capacitor will
flow through and charge CGS beyond Vth and turn the device on. This event, sometimes called **Miller
turn-on**, can be very dissipative
</br>![](images/GaNMillerTurnOn.png?raw=true)

* To determine the dv/dt susceptibility of a power device, a Miller charge ratio (QGD/QGS1), as
function of drain-to-source voltage, needs to be evaluated. **A Miller ratio of less than
 one will guarantee dv/dt immunity.**

* A rising current through an off-state device, as shown in Figure 3.12, will induce a step
voltage across the **common-source inductance (CSI)**. The CSI is the inductance on
 the source side of a device that is common to both the power loop (drain-to-source current) and
  the gate drive loop (gate-to-source current).
</br>![](images/GaNdidt.png?raw=true)

* A better solution is to limit the size of the CSI through improved packaging and device
layout. This is accomplished by **separating the gate and power loops** to as close to the
 GaN device as possible, and minimizing the internal source inductance of the GaN device,
  which will remain common to both loops.

* There is a tradeoff between too much filtering causing significant delay and pulse width distortion due to variation
 in the gate driver input thresholds, or not enough filtering maintaining susceptibility to logic glitches. The second alternative solution
  is to use a level-shifter or isolator between the controller and the gate driver. This approach effectively treats the low-side gate
  driver the same way as the floating high-side driver. Although **a level-shifter** increases complexity and component count,
  it does have the added advantage of **improving the gate driver propagation delay matching** between the high side and low side.

* It is generally concluded that these **RF-based digital isolators tolerate higher dv/dt** than alterna- tives.  

## Measurement

#### GaN Transistors for Efficient Power Conversion. (2014). https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118844779
* To yield an accurate representation of the waveform rise time, a rule of thumb is that a
 **bandwidth between three and five times** that of Equation 5.1 is required
</br>![](images/ScopeBW.png?raw=true)

* However, the oscilloscope alone cannot measure the switching waveforms.
**A voltage probe, with its own associated bandwidth limitations**, is also required.
 For such a cascade system, the effective rise time is given by the root-mean-square
  (RMS) of separate component rise times. This can be expressed in terms of component
  bandwidths as in Equation 5.3 [13]:
</br>![](images/ScopeProbeBW.png?raw=true)

* Due to their size and shape, **coaxial shunts add a larger amount of inductance** to the overall circuit, and
any significant increase in power loop inductance will adversely affect switching operation.

* The C-V measurement is conducted as follows. Under a given gate bias condition, **a high-frequency
(e.g. 1MHz) AC voltage signal would be applied to the capacitor under test.** By measuring the output
 current, the impedance (which includes conductance and capacitance) value could be calculated.
  However, some terminal capacitances, such as gate-to-drain capacitance (Cgd), could not be directly
   measured without additional setups. As illustrated in Fig. 6(a), by connecting device’s S terminal
   to AC guard, the AC disturbance signal would be cut off. As a result, the Cgd-Vdg curve could be
   acquired.

* Recently Magnetoresistor (MR) based current sensors are gaining popularity
for high frequency current sensing in power electronic applications due to their inherent capability of
responding to high frequency transients and lower temperature drift [15]-[19].
</br>![](images/MR.jpg?raw=true)

* The sensors are placed in such a way that the magnetic field
generated by the current flowing through the GaN transistors (as shown in Yellow lines in Fig. 4) crosses the sensors through their sensing axis.

* Theoretically, they also should not have any impact on the switch current measurement by the AMR sensor.

* The **desaturation detection circuit’s sensing diode** requires **significant settling time** after the drain voltage falls in turn-on transients. This diode also **adds capacitive loading in parallel with the output capacitance, which increases switching loss**.

* The **internal gate voltage acts as a diode**, due to the junction created by the p-doped GaN layer implanted beneath the gate metallization. As with a discrete diode, **there is a measurable relationship between its voltage and current**.
</br>![](images/GaNProtectionIdVgs.jpg?raw=true)

The main logic is that </br>
i) The gate of the **GIT device** sinks a current under steady state operation</br>
ii) Therefore, Vgs,diode is constant for steady-State </br>
iii) There is a relation between Id and Vgs,ext which says the current can be followed through Vgs,ext
</br>![](images/GaNProtectionEqn.jpg?raw=true)

* Vgs,sense must be filtered for immunity to turn-on transient spikes and noise

* One of the reasons that strong noise immunity and fast
response are expected from **this protection circuit** is that it **uses the same references and supply voltages as the gate driver IC**, **avoiding the need for any isolation** between the sensed gate voltage and the comparator circuit.

* The short-circuit tests are conducted with the circuit given below.
</br>![](images/ProtectionTestCircuit.jpg?raw=true)

* The **stray inductance** and **thermal effects** need **to be considered** to describe the short circuit current characteristics

* It is obvious that a **change of the external gate resistance** (in the example from Rg=12Ω to 90Ω) has only **a marginal impact on the peak short circuit current**. The **gate resistance determines** the time constant RgCeq at which the gate is charged, and hence influences the **di/dt** during the charging process.

* The **parasitic method shows a faster detection time than the desaturation method**. The larger delay in the desaturation method is mainly due to the junction capacitance of the DDESAT and its reverse recovery characteristics [10-12].

* The desaturation method shows a higher fault response time compared to the parasitics technique. Using the parasitics method, the maximum fault current is reduced by around 20%.

* From the table we can know, the **gate threshold voltage of the device is just 1.4V, which is far below the silicon power MOSFET’s**, which leads to **an easier conduction false**. Its **parasitic capacitors**, which include input capacitor (Ciss) and output capacitor (Coss), **are also smaller than the silicon power MOSFET**, so as to realize higher switching speed and smaller switching loss.

* Commonly there are **two methods to detect the drain current**. **First**, we can **cascade a very small resistance R** on the GaN HEMT, and the voltage of the resistance is VR (VR ?I? ·R). By detecting the voltage of the resistance, it can realize the judgment of the overcurrent fault.  **Second**, we can **detect the drain-source voltage of GaN HEMT** V?? to realize the detection of its drain current I?.

* **Under the short circuit conditio**, the monitored phase-leg **voltage** (Vplv) **will show a sudden dip** due to the parasitic inductance in the power loop and a high di/dt. When the sudden voltage dip is detected, the fault trigger flag will be set.

* A conventional desaturation detection circuit is deployed to confirm the short circuit fault and slowly turns off the device.

* In this paper, the discrete protection circuit is applied to the GaN HEMT by utilizing the GaNPX® dual-gate pads structure. By doing so, **it can keep the conventional, straightforward gate driver loop layout of GaN** and also provide the flexibility in terms of power loop layout. In other words, depending on the specific PCB system structure, **system designers can choose to place the protection circuit either on the same side of the gate driver or the opposite side to the gate driver**.

* Fig. 4 shows the hard switch-on peak currents under 400 V with different load currents. **If the load current is around 4 A, the peak current on the device can be 7 times higher to the load current**. Therefore, it is important to **guarantee the protection circuit will not be mis-triggered** during this normal peak current transient
</br>![](images/CurrentOvershoot.jpg?raw=true)

* **Reducing the gate current** during a short circuit fault **helps to lower the short circuit energy**, extend the short circuit survive device time, and prevent degradation.

* The **proposed three-step short-circuit protection method** is based on an **ultra-fast fault detection**, followed by the **active gate current clamping**, and the **de-saturation protection confirmation**. The proposed detection **method utilizes the effect of the short circuit event’s high di/dt on the stray inductance** in the power loop.

* Compared to a normal operation condition, the **di/dt during short-circuit faults is usually larger**. Thus, the
**amplitude of the resulting voltage dip under the short-circuit conditions can be differentiated from normal conditions**. The voltage dip occurs as soon as the short-circuit fault occurs, and then the voltage is gradually damped as the decoupling capacitor provides the energy for the short circuit current.

* The **traditional SCP/OCP methods** can be summarized as below, 1) integrated **de-saturation detection** in gate-driver; 2) current **sense resistor**; 3) **di/dt detection by voltage sensing across common source inductance** [10]-[12]. However, the **delay time for the traditional integrated de-saturation detection** in gate-driver is typically about 2.5 μs, which might be slow for GaN HEMT; The current **sense resistor will add additional parasitic inductance** into the power circuit, which will affect the switching performance; The **voltage sensing across common source inductance is not practical** for GaN, as the stray inductance in the circuit must be minimized.

* Clearly, **with higher junction temperature, the saturation current gets lower**. The second factor that contributes to the saturation current reduction can be on the gate. It has been proven that the **fast increase of the temperature has an effect on the gate current** [9]. With a higher temperature, the **gate current becomes higher**. Therefore, **it introduces a larger voltage drop on the gate**. This can be another reason cause the saturation current reduction.

* The **main challenge for parallel** operation is thought to be
the diverse **parasitics of the power stage and gate driver circuits**,
which are very sensitive to the high di/dt and dv/dt.

* As Vgs increase, **d(Id)/dt will start to affect Vgs via mutual loop** and power commutation loop as described in many previous works. **To minimize this effect, the Kelvin terminal is usually employed** in high-frequency applications to bypass the common source inductance.

* However, **though the paralleled transistors will share the
same gate driver chip and employ Kelvin connections in the design,
d(Id)/dt could still potentially be problematic** due to the **existence of the quasi-common-source inductance**. The imbalanced quasi-common source inductance or di/dt will eventually cause a resultant feedback voltage across the Vgs.

* On one hand, **the unbalanced quasi-common will help balance dynamic current distribution by lowering the transistor Vgs of higher transition speed**. On the other hand, the **feedback voltage might potentially cause overshoot or undamped ringing on Vgs**.

* For layout design, it is **suggested to minimize and evenly distribute the quasi-common source inductance**, which is so critical that an unsynchronized gate driver circuit is proposed to solve unbalanced quasi-common source inductance issue.

* According to the law of electromagnetic induction, with the **multi-layer magnetic-flux-canceling design strategy**, the parasitics of the trace could be greatly reduced – the direction of the commutation current on **two adjacent layers are opposite so that the generated flux outside the loop are canceling** each other.

* Generally speaking, **in hard switching application, the more transistors we parallel, the higher switching loss we will have**.

* **Parasitic capacitance of PCB and magnetic components is
not ignorable** compared with the ultra-small Coss of GaN HEMT. The parasitic capacitance in a half bridge module is extracted by ANSYS Q3D as Figure 13, indicating **the parasitic capacitance in one leg is 0.6 nF (0.4 nF to BUS+ and 0.2 nF to BUS- node)**.
